You can find the current MeshMixer 3.2 on the http://www.meshmixer.com/[program's website]. There are versions for Windows and macOS.

There was an experimental package for Ubuntu 14.04 (you can relatively easily create an
https://github.com/hroncok/meshmixer-docker/blob/master/README.md#how-to-create-meshmixer-appimage[AppImage] from it
and run it on other distributions, or you can take it from the faculty
computer).

Video tutorials are created for version 2.9:

Cura is available in two variants, I recommend downloading the older version
https://www.lulzbot.com/cura[Cura Lulzbot Edition] or
https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software/list[older version
Ultimaker Cura (15.x)] (the new version is completely redesigned and the tutorial won't
match).

== MeshMixer 2.4

This part of the tutorial (without videos) is for a very old version of MeshMixer, but
you can get by with just one program.

=== Installation

MeshMixer 2.4 can be found on the http://www.meshmixer.com/[program's website].
There are versions for Windows and macOS. In Linux, the Windows version can
be installed using Wine, but you must supply the program folder
(usually `~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Autodesk/Meshmixer/`) with the files
http://www.dllme.com/dll/files/mfc110u_dll.html[mfc110u.dll] and
http://www.dllme.com/dll/files/prntvpt_dll.html[prntvpt.dll]. The only
problem we've encountered is strange fonts and a crash on first launch.

=== Cutting an Object

First import the STL file using the _Import_ button.

Then select _Plane Cut_ from the _Edit_ menu.

Using various arrows you can manipulate the cutting plane. You can also
drag with the mouse button held down to create a line (red in the picture), along which
the plane will move, parallel to your view. If the object is positioned
unfavorably, you can rotate it with the right mouse button. Before pressing
the _Accept_ button, make sure you have selected _Type: Slice_, otherwise
you'll end up with only one part of the object.

After cutting, the object looks the same as before. You must again select _Separate Shells_ from the _Edit_ menu.

In the modal window you can select which shell will be visible, or on
which actions are performed (note, this is different, one is controlled by the eye icon, the other
by selecting and highlighting that shell in the list). Immediately for
one shell select _Align_ from the _Edit_ menu. This is so that
the object lies on a flat part, otherwise the cut was pointless.

In the _Align_ dialog, the Y axis is selected by default. This should
ensure laying the object flat (although possibly upside down, we'll get to that),
so just click _Accept_.

image::meshmixer9.png[width=500]

From the _File_ menu, choose _Export_ and save that part as an STL file.
I recommend checking that you exported the correct part (by opening
the resulting STL in some program).

image::meshmixer10.png[width=500]

Repeat the process for the second half. Here we encountered a case where _Align_
rotates the object differently than we want. Just click on the arrow (marked
with a green dot) and continue as with the previous part.
