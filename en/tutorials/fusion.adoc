== What is FUSION?

Fusion 360 is an integrated software tool designed for 3D modeling,
simulation, and manufacturing (CAD/CAM/CAE), developed by Autodesk. It
is a cloud-based platform that allows users to design and create
3D models, perform analyses and simulations, and also directly generate
instructions for manufacturing. CAD (Computer-Aided Design) focuses on creating
digital models and drawing, CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)
deals with the manufacturing process and generating control programs for machines,
while CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) includes simulations and analyses for
verifying functionality and performance of the designed product. Fusion 360 combines
these three disciplines into one comprehensive environment, which allows
users to completely integrate design, manufacturing and testing of products.

== How to Model in Fusion

The basics of modeling in Fusion 360 include familiarization with tools for
creating and editing geometry, such as extrude, revolve, cut, and
merge, which allow creating 3D objects. It's also important
to understand the concepts of work planes (sketches), which serve as
the basis for creating 3D models. In addition, it's important to learn
to use tools for editing shapes, such as folding, pulling,
bending, and straightening, to be able to create more complex geometries.
An important part is also understanding the concept of parametric
modeling, which allows defining dimensions and properties of objects using
parameters, which facilitates their editing and modification during the design process. These
basics provide users with a solid foundation for creating and editing 3D models
in Fusion 360.

== Sketches

In Fusion 360, a "sketch" is the basic element for creating 3D
models. A sketch is a 2D outline or plan that defines the shape and dimensions of a 3D
object. Here's a description of how sketches work in Fusion 360:

* *Creating a new sketch:* First select the plane on which you want to
create a sketch. This can be, for example, the XY, YZ, or XZ plane. Then
click on the appropriate tool for creating a new sketch.
* *Drawing:* After creating a sketch you can start drawing. Fusion 360 offers
various drawing tools, such as lines, arcs, circles, ellipses,
etc. You can also use construction tools, such as for example
lines, circles, or point dimensions for defining relationships and dimensions.
* *Editing and modification:* After finishing drawing you can perform various
edits and modifications. You can move, bend, trim, split, or
join sketch elements. You can also use shape editing tools, such
as "fillet" (rounding) or "chamfer" (beveling), for changing the shape
of edges.
* *Creating a 3D object:* After finishing the sketch you can use various
tools to transform the sketch into a 3D object. This can be for example
extrude, revolve, or cut, which convert your 2D sketch into a 3D
model.
* *Editing:* The sketch is still editable even after you've converted it to
a 3D object. You can return to it at any time, edit it, and changes will
automatically be reflected in the 3D model.

Overall, the sketch in Fusion 360 is a flexible and powerful tool that
allows users to easily create and edit 3D models using
simple 2D drawings.

== Constraints

In Fusion 360, blue and black constraints are important
components of the sketch creation process. Here's an explanation:

* *Blue constraints (Constraints):* Blue constraints in Fusion 360 indicate
geometric constraints that are applied to elements in the sketch. This
includes relationships between points, lines, arcs, and other elements. For example,
a point can be placed at a certain location in relation to another point, a line
can be perpendicular to another line, or an arc can be concentric with another
arc. Blue constraints are important for maintaining geometric
properties and correct behavior of the sketch.
* *Black constraints (Constraints):* Black constraints indicate dimensional
constraints in the sketch. This means they determine precise dimensions and distances
between elements in the sketch. For example, you can define the length of a line segment, the radius
of an arc, or the distance between two points. Black constraints are key for
ensuring precision and consistency of dimensions in your sketch.

== Sketch on an Extruded Surface

Creating a sketch on an extruded surface in Fusion 360 is a common operation
that allows creating additional geometry on an already existing 3D object. Here's
the procedure:

* *Opening file and selecting surface:* Open your project in Fusion 360
and find the object on which you want to create a sketch. This can be for example
a cylinder, cuboid, or other 3D shape. Then select the surface of this object on
which you want to create a new sketch.
* *Creating a new sketch:* After selecting the surface, press the "Create
Sketch" button in the top panel. This creates a new sketch on the selected surface.
* *Drawing:* Now you can start drawing new elements in the sketch. You can
use various drawing tools, such as lines, arcs, circles,
and more, to create the desired geometry.
* *Using constraints and dimensions:* Apply blue and black constraints
(constraints) to your drawing if needed to maintain
precision and geometric properties. This can include specifying lengths, angles,
relationships between elements, etc.
* *Extrusion:* Once you have a finished sketch, use the "Extrude" tool to
convert the sketch into a 3D object. Press the
"Extrude" button in the top panel, then select the area you want to
extrude and set the desired extrusion depth.

This way you can create new geometry on an already existing 3D
object in Fusion 360.

== Projection

Projection in Fusion 360 is a process that allows importing
geometry from one object into a sketch or into another 3D object. This
process is useful for working with existing geometric elements or for
copying their shape into a new context. Here's a brief description of how
projection works in Fusion 360:

* *Selecting source geometry:* First you need to select the object from which
you want to perform projection. This can be an existing sketch, 3D body, or
other element.
* *Running the projection command:* After you have the source
object selected, run the projection command. In Fusion 360, this command
is usually called "Project" or "Project/Include".
* *Selecting projection target:* Then select the plane or surface onto
which you want to perform projection of the source geometry. This plane or
surface will serve as the target for the imported geometry.
* *Performing projection:* After selecting the target surface or plane, run
the projection. Fusion 360 imports contours and elements of the source geometry into
the selected plane or surface. This creates new geometric elements that
can be used within the sketch or another 3D object.

== Planes

In Fusion 360, "planes" are reference surfaces that serve for
placing and orienting sketches, models, and other elements in your design. Here
are several important aspects of these planes:

* *Default planes:* Fusion 360 contains three default planes: XY plane,
YZ, and XZ. These planes form the basic reference frame for creating
your designs. The XY plane lies in the plane given by x and y axes, the YZ plane in
the plane given by y and z axes, and the XZ plane in the plane given by x and z axes.
* *Creating additional planes:* In addition to default planes, you can in Fusion 360
create additional planes as needed. This can be for example a plane at
a certain distance from existing elements, a plane at a certain angle, or
a plane at a certain distance from a certain point.
* *Use in modeling:* Planes are used for placing sketches, extrusions, and
other modeling operations. For example, you can create a sketch on the XY plane
and then extrude this sketch into 3D shapes.
* *Arranging elements:* Planes allow precise arrangement of elements in your
design and maintain consistency and precision of your model.

== Components

A component in Fusion 360 is
the basic building block of your design that serves for organization and
management of your models. Here are key points regarding components in
Fusion 360:

* *Separation of design:* Components allow logical separation of different parts
of your model. This is useful for organizing complex designs because
it allows easier management and editing.

* *Independence:* Each component has its own design space and
its own set of operations. This means that changes made in one component
don't affect other components, which allows isolated work on different
parts of the project.

* *Convenient editing:* Thanks to components you can easily edit and change
different parts of your model without negative impact on the rest of the design. This
simplifies the iterative design process and allows faster creation and
testing of different variants.

* *Organization and management:* Components allow structuring your design
and easy organization of files. For example, you can group related
parts into one component, which facilitates tracking and project management.

* *Export and sharing:* Components also facilitate export and sharing of your
design with other users. You can export individual components
or the entire file and share them with colleagues or other users for
collaboration or presentation.

== Section Analysis

Section analysis (often called "cross-section analysis" in Czech) is a function
that you can use in some CAD software applications, including
Fusion 360. This function allows visualization and analysis of the internal structure
of objects or components using a cross-section through the model.

Here's what you can expect from section analysis in Fusion 360:

* *Visualization of internal structure:* Using the section analysis function you can
create a cross-section through your 3D models. This allows you to see the internal
structure and geometry of objects that would otherwise not be visible.
* *Detailed analysis:* Section analysis allows you to perform detailed
analyses of geometric elements in your model. For example, you can measure
distances, dimensions, and other parameters of internal elements.
* *Assembly and interference checking:* This function is useful when checking
assemblies and detecting interferences between different parts of the model. Using a cross-section
you can easily determine if individual parts collide with each other or
if they're properly aligned.
* *Visualization of material properties:* Some CAD applications, including
Fusion 360, also allow displaying material properties in cross-section.
This allows you to visualize different materials or material
properties, such as density, strength, etc.

Using section analysis is a useful tool for detailed analysis and
visualization of your 3D models and allows better understanding of their internal
structure and geometry.

== Rectangular Pattern

The "Rectangular Pattern" function in Fusion 360 allows repeating
an element or set of elements in the form of a rectangular pattern. Here's a brief description of how it works:

* ***Element selection:** First select the element or set of elements you want to
repeat in the pattern. This can be a geometric element in a sketch, 3D object, or entire component.

* ***Running the command:** After you have the required element selected,
run the "Rectangular Pattern" command. This command can usually be found in
the top panel or in the "Create" menu.

* ***Setting parameters:** After running the command you need to set the parameters
of the rectangular pattern. This includes the number of replications in the X and Y directions, as well as
the distance between individual replications in the X and Y directions. You can also define
rotation angle and other options as needed.

* ***Preview and confirmation:** After entering the required parameters, a preview
of the rectangular pattern is displayed. You can review how the element replications will be placed.
If you're satisfied with the preview, confirm the action and apply the rectangular pattern.

* ***Completion:** After confirmation, the rectangular pattern is applied to your selected element
or set of elements. Fusion 360 automatically creates the required number of replications including
set parameters.

This way you can easily and quickly repeat elements in the form of a rectangular pattern
in your model in Fusion 360.
