= Printing: Supports
:toc:

It's not always the case that a model can be printed on an FDM printer as it is.
You already know that under certain circumstances, you can print things into thin air.
But how to do it when it's not a bridge?

One option is to print supporting structures under the object, supports,
or more often in English *support*. Today's exercise is about that.

To print with supports, this functionality needs to be explicitly enabled in Slic3r
on the _Support material_ page.

Slic3r can detect where support is needed by itself, you just need to tell it
what our printer can still handle. This depends on various circumstances,
such as print speed, printing material properties,
ambient temperature, and active cooling.

NOTE: Generally, the more you blow on the object, the larger overhangs can be printed and less support is needed.
Some materials (e.g., ABS) practically can't be blown on because too much stress would arise and the object would crack.
If you print from PET or PLA, it's often possible to relatively limit supports.

IMPORTANT: For today's exercise, download the general xref:printing#config-file[Config Bundle for Slic3r],
so don't use the one from the bridges exercise.

WARNING: Follow all safety rules from xref:printing.adoc#[the printing exercise].
Especially don't eat superglue and don't disassemble the printer power supply plastic cover.


== Tasks

=== What Can It Do? (2 points)

Your task for two points is to prepare or find a suitable test model on which you'll verify
how large overhangs the printer prints without problems without support.

You can use, for example, the https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=overhang+test[Thingiverse.com] portal
and search for "overhang test".

In case of Thingiverse.com portal outage, we have some models available here as well:

==== Instructions

1. Since you downloaded a model from the Internet, you should first check the mesh correctness.
1. Scale the model appropriately so you have time to finish the task; know, however, that a too small model may affect the test.
1. First print the model without support; if necessary, stop printing at an appropriate time.
1. Then set the support angle so the model can be printed, but with as little support as possible; print the model again.

NOTE: The test model must stay on the print bed.
Use appropriate techniques that you know from the chapter xref:slicing.adoc#structs[slicing].

IMPORTANT: Before printing, always review the Gcode preview and check
that support is actually located where you expect it.

WARNING: If the test model prints right the first time without supports,
does it mean the printer prints anything, or that you performed an insufficient test?

TIP: Save time. When printing this task, you can also print the bear from the next task.
How will this affect the total print time and why?

=== How to Avoid Supports? (1 point)

Your task for one point is to print link:../stls/supports/bear.stl[the bear] without supports.
You must cut it appropriately, print it, and then (optionally) glue it with superglue.
You can use Slic3r for cutting; before a longitudinal cut, you can rotate the object.

==== Instructions

- For a longitudinal cut through the object, use the _Cut_ button. You want to keep both parts (_Keep:_ _Upper part_, _Lower part_) and use the _Rotate lower part upwards_ option.
- To rotate the object along an axis other than Z, use the object's context menu (right-click on the object on the _3D_ tab).

.Cutting the bear and cut options (cut height chosen randomly here so as not to give you a hint)

IMPORTANT: Gluing is quite demanding; try to cut the bear into as few parts as possible.

WARNING: When working with glue, exercise increased caution and don't damage classroom equipment.


=== Cleanup (mandatory)

Those who don't xref:printing.adoc#ukol-3[clean up after themselves] don't get any points.
